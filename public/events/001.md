# Actions upon Planet Lambda 02
The war upon the resistance forces of Lambda 02 against the oppresive force of Aeon soldiers have started to come to a head. After nearly five years of conflict, the resistance forces have begun their penultimate assault - a raid upon Tollsholm City, the final bastion of all Aeon Forces.

Leading the charge against the resistance is not a powerful general nor a brilliant commander, but the resistance defector and Aeon hero Colonel Bridges Collard. Acting as the moral and spiritual leader of the Aeon forces thanks to his background and genius intellect, he signifies everything the Aeon forces respect - and the Resistance fear. Capturing him alive is a higher priority than taking the city itself.

# Close but no Cigar

Although the battle rages on within various parts of the city and beyond, an incident involving a younger group of unaffiliated Lancers has brought an end to the war closer than the last few years of the war combined - Colonel Collard had been spotted within the city, his escape from the incident delayed due to unforseen circumstances. Although the information was Solid, the Colonel has managed to escape the grasp of the Lancers, up until now.

Now, with his forces cornered, and his escape shuttle still not arrived, the team have one final chance to capture him, come hell or high water.

# A Diplomatic Mission
**Operation Solstice Rain** begins amidst this ongoing diplomatic process, during Union’s third visit to Cressidium. These trips have been largely uneventful thus far, with most of the delegation group’s time spent shuttling diplomats and scientists to and from the planet, loading and unloading cargo, and running various drills. The action has been taking place behind closed doors on **Cressidium’s** surface with Union **Ambassador Nilan Bannerjee** engaging in delicate negotiations between two of the planet’s major nations, the **Leandric States Alliance** and the **Vestan Sovereignty**.

# The Drop
“As of 1400 hours, we are on combat alert. Several hours ago, we received a transmission from **Ambassador Bannerjee** that civil defense warnings were being sounded across **Nov Elysia**. Then all communications with the surface went dark, and we’ve been unable to raise the ambassador, the captain, or anyone within the local government. Based on orbital flyover imagery gathered by **Rio**, it appears that **Nov Elysia** is under attack by **Vestan Sovereignty forces**, with significant deployment of mechanized chassis forces throughout the city.” Cressidium is not officially a member of Union at this point. Militarily, we aren’t authorized to intervene on behalf of the LSA in this conflict, but simply leaving **Captain Farris** and **Ambassador Bannerjee** to ride this out on their own is not an option. As such, after conferring with the other officers aboard this ship, it’s been decided that we will be conducting a rescue operation with the primary objective of first locating, then securing the ambassador and the captain, and safely escorting them to an extraction point. Rules of engagement for this operation are that you are not to engage unless fired upon. Our main priority here is to bring our people home.”
